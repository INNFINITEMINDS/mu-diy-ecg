## Instructions:
To download all of the code necessary to run the project, click the green "Clone or Download" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. This will download a zip file of all of the files in this repository.

Alternatively, you can click the folders and only download the bits of code that you need. The explanation of what each bit of code does is shown below.

You will need both the Arduino IDE and Processing IDE (currently only works with Processing version 2).
You can find those at:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
https://processing.org/

## Folder Explanations
### arduino_instructions
This folder contains the completed and correct version of the Arduino code necessary to run the MU DIY ECG project. To use, open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE.

### arduino_instructions_LED
This folder contains the completed and correct version of the Arduino code necessary to run the MU DIY ECG project with the LED display option. To use, open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE.

### arduino_instructions_broken
This folder contains the "broken" version of the Arduino code and is intended as a problem for outreach participants to solve. To use, open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE.

### trace_ecg
This folder contains the completed and correct version of the Processing code necessary to visualize and ECG. Note: you can only use processing version 2, this is not currently compatible with processing version 3 yet.

## Other Folders:
### arduino_example
This folder contains a processing code example for development purposes only. You do not need it to run this project but does give you an idea of how to use processing. To use, open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE.

### screenshots
This folder has some screenshots of the working processing code.

### sparkfun
Folder that contains the code provided by sparkfun.com to run with the heart rate monitor. For reference and development purposes only.
